                    Don't need to worry if you don't know what CSS or JAVASCRIPT means in context for this course. We
                    will
                    introduce you with them in near future. For now just think of them as supporting pillars to the
                    html,
                    because HTML is just like a raw vegetable (You need to include some spices and ingredients to make
                    it
                    taste good and worth having). CSS is used in html to beautify what you wanna show, because what
                    looks
                    good feels good and also it increases the appeal to the user <a
                        href="https://techterms.com/definition/user-friendly" target="_blank"> (Good user experience and
                        User friendly) </a>. Also JAVASCRIPT is used to perform action on the html page and handle any
                    action performed made by user.
                </div>
                <div class="side-note"> Note : we will understand deeply how CSS and JAVASCRIPT works, once we have
                    complete
                    understanding of HTML. </div>

                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the
                        meaning
                        and
                        structure of web content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single
                        website or
                        between websites.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it
                        to
                        pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

                    Lets understand it like this, for anything on internet you need some type of method where you can
                    write
                    you content.
                    Also to view that content we need a tool where we can open that content.

                    Html is just like any other file on the system. It have the extension of html, htm for example
                    index.html or index.htm index.html (perviously html was not supported by DOS operating systems thus
                    htm
                    was introduce, but now all OS support html).
